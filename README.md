# Zen Massage

Seed project to explore using 
* Angular 2
* Bootstrap 4
* Typescript
* SystemJS
* MVC 6
* NPM
* Gulp

Getting all these moving parts to play nicely together is fairly tricky and subject to change since I'm riding the beta wave on not one but two different frameworks!

Feel free to contribute, comment and reuse all that you see here.

# Requirements
1. An internet connection (so you can download node modules and such)
2. Visual Studio 2015 (should also work with Visual Studio Code)
3. NodeJS (currently using version 5.3.0)

# Next Steps
1. Integration of IoC for server-side code (likely using Autofac)
2. Integration of unit testing of both server-side and client-side code (likely using xUnit and mocha)
3. Fleshing out Angular logic and adding some nice bells and whistles
4. Making the Bootstrap UI look a little nicer

# Credits
Big thanks to Dan Wahlin for the Angular 2 starting point.
