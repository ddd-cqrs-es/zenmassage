# Zen Massage

Three applications designed to explore three different runtime environments.

## Zen Massage Site

Seed web application project using;
 
 * Angular 2
 * Bootstrap 4
 * Typescript
 * SystemJS
 * MVC 6
 * NPM
 * Gulp

## Zen Massage (Mobile)

Companion Apache Cordova mobile project using;

 * Cordova 5.4.1
 * Onsen UI 2.0.0 beta
 * Angular 1
 * Typescript
 * NPM
 * Gulp

## Zen Massage (Pebble)

Pebble smart-watch application (via different github repo github.com/dementeddevil/zenmassagepebble )
This application makes use of the seed web application to host the Pebble App Configuration Pages and
will eventually explore management of shared and user-specific timeline pins.
This application will also feature tight integration with the mobile application (at least on Android)

Getting all these moving parts to play nicely together is fairly tricky and subject to change since I'm riding the beta wave on not one but two different frameworks!

Feel free to contribute, comment and reuse all that you see here.

# Requirements
1. An internet connection (so you can download node modules and such)
2. Visual Studio 2015 (should also work with Visual Studio Code)
3. NodeJS (currently using version 5.4.1)

# Next Steps
1. Integration of unit testing of both server-side and client-side code (likely using xUnit and mocha)
2. Fleshing out Angular logic and adding some nice bells and whistles
3. Making the Bootstrap UI look a little nicer

# Credits
Big thanks to Dan Wahlin for the Angular 2 starting point.
